Online gaming store using PHP and AJAX

First large scale project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

An online gaming store with multiple products classified by brands and categories to help in user experience. The website allows the user to register into a new account, login with an existing account, buy products, view his cart, view his purchase history, and finally add products to a wishlist.

Wishlist, purchase history, add to cart button, add to wishlist button, the cart button, only appear when the user is signed in.

There is an admin page which can add a user "customer" or add a product to the database using username: admin, and password: admin.

The whole project was developed using vanilla code and the database was developed using mysql using xampp.
